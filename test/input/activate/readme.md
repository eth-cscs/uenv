Activation scripts from uenv, as inputs for unit testing.

The naming scheme is as follows:

```
{uenv}-{version}[_{tag}]-{view}.sh
```

`arbor-v0.9-develop.sh` is the `develop` view of `arbor/v0.9` with no tag.

`icon-wcp-v1_v2-default.sh` is the `default` view of `icon-wcp/v1:v2`.

Scripts are organised in sub-directories that match the version of stackinator used to generate them.
